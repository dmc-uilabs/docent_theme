		<dt>Acquisition Strategy</dt>
		<dd>A business and technical management approach designed to achieve program objectives within the resource constraints imposed. It is the framework for planning, directing, contracting for, and managing a program. It provides a master schedule for research, development, test, production, fielding, modification, post-production management, and other activities essential for program success. The acquisition strategy is the basis for formulating functional plans and strategies (e.g., Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP), Systems Engineering Plan (SEP), Manufacturing Management Plan (MMP), Quality Assurance Plan (QAP), etc.). Once approved by the MDA, the Acquisition Strategy provides a basis for more detailed planning.</dd>

		<dt>Advanced Technology Development</dt>
		<dd>A demonstration of the maturity and potential of advanced technologies for enhanced military operational capability or cost effectiveness.</dd>

		
		<dt>Affordability</dt>
		<dd>The degree to which the life cycle cost of an acquisition program is in consonance with the long-range investment plans of the customer.</dd>

	
		<dt>Alternative Systems Review</dt>
		<dd>A multi-disciplined technical review to ensure that requirements agree with the customersâ€™ needs and expectations and that the system under review can proceed into the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase. The ASR should be completed prior to Milestone A.</dd>
		<dt>Analysis of Alternatives</dt>
		<dd>The AoA assesses potential material solutions to satisfy the capability need documented in the approved Initial Capabilities Document (ICD). It focuses on identification an analysis of alternatives, measures of effectiveness (MOEs), cost, schedule, concepts of operations, and overall risk, including the sensitivity of each alternative to possible changes in key assumptions of variables. The AoA also assesses critical Technologies (CTs) associated with each proposed material solution, including technology maturity, integration risk, manufacturing feasibility, and, where necessary, technology maturation and demostration needs. The AoA is normally coducted during the Material Solution Analysis (MSA) phase of the Defense Acquisition Management System (DAMS), is a key input to the Capabilitiy Development Document (CDD), and supports the material solition decision at Milestone A.</dd>
